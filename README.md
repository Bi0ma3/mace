#  🧬 The Multi-omics Annotation Classification Engine (MACE)
*A machine learning engine designed to annotate DNA using Deep Learning methoology*

### **Why it matters**
  🔬 MACE bridges the gaps between raw data and useful DNA sequences related to protien and RNA information
  🧠 MACE utlizes an *multi*-omics approach by considering DNA, RNA and protien data which mimics biology
  🥼 MACE offers a faster, consistentm scalable alternative to gene annoatation. Ths leads to increased accuracy and precision in personalized medicine and genomics
