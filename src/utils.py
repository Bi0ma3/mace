# utils.py
# 
# This module contains general-purpose utility functions used across the MACE project.
# These should include file handling, logging, reproducibility (like setting random seeds),
# metric calculations, data validation, or any other helper logic that does't belong to a specific module.
# Keeping this functionality modular helps simplify other scripts and improve code reuse.
