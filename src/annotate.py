# annotate.py
#
# This module will be responsible for post-processing model predictions by mapping them back to
# biological sequence identifiers, functional annotations, or gene/protein metadata.
# Typical functions might include:
# - attaching predicted labels or scores to sequence records,
# - formatting results for export (we could do CSV, JSON??),
# - and of course, enriching results with domain-specific annotations (using external databases).
# It will serve as the final step in the MACE pipeline before reporting or visualization.
